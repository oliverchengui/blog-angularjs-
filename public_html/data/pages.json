        "content": "I am eager to learn new things, especially the cloud system, mobile application development and networking. That passion motivates me to take the information security course, because internet is our second world that we need securities to protect our online properties and privacies. Cryptography requires mathematics background to understand or develop different algorithms so I was minor in mathematics two years ago. I have taken some deep courses about linear algebra, differential equation, mathematical proofing and mathematical modeling that help me to strengthen my logic and math sense. I keep tracking new technology that may apply to my future products. Sometimes I will daydream about what new technology can make our lives better. I am not a typical computer science student. I love all outdoor activities, such as biking, hiking and rock climbing which reduce my pressure and inspire new ideas.Recently, I worked as an App Instructor to introduce kids (8 to12 years old) to the basic programming with Java and Python. Kids returning for the second week will take the skills from week on and apply them towards developing the calculator app and any additional apps they would like to make, depending on their abilities, interest and skills. I helped troubleshoot, suggested methods of improving critical thinking skills in relation to programming, and encouraged problem solving techniques to strengthen the curious, inventive, and creative spirit of software development and programming experimentation."
