This is a simple blog. 
I have used $routeprovider and $routeparam to do the routing.
And I have used $http to do AJAX call.

Comment service and Authenitication service is still under working.

Plan for Comment service:
using recursive template so inside the comment tab can contain comment tab

Plan for Authentication sevice:
Using base64 to do encoding.
To be more practical, I may use timestamp append with my username and password to prevent replay attack.
